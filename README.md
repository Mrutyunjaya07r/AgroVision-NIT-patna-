🌱 AgroVision – Intelligent Agriculture Platform (MERN Stack + TensorFlow.js)
AgroVision is a comprehensive, AI-powered web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) with seamless integration of TensorFlow.js for real-time machine learning. It is designed to assist farmers, agricultural researchers, and agritech professionals in making data-driven decisions for sustainable and profitable farming.

This project merges modern web development with artificial intelligence to solve real-world agricultural challenges such as inappropriate fertilizer usage, unsuitable crop selection, and undiagnosed plant diseases—all through a user-friendly and interactive platform.

🌟 Core Objectives:
Enhance Crop Yield using smart AI models tailored to local environmental and soil conditions.

Support Sustainable Farming by providing personalized recommendations for fertilizers and crop types.

Leverage Edge AI with TensorFlow.js for in-browser disease detection, reducing the need for server-side processing.

🔧 Key Features and Modules:
🧪 1. Fertilizer Recommendation System
AI model analyzes soil parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, pH, and moisture.

Combines real-time weather API data to provide optimized fertilizer suggestions.

Empowers farmers to apply the right nutrients, minimizing cost and environmental impact.

🌾 2. Crop Prediction System
Predicts the most suitable crops to grow based on user-input soil conditions.

Utilizes decision trees or neural networks trained on agricultural datasets.

Encourages diversification and maximizes land use efficiency.

🦠 3. Plant Disease Detection (via TensorFlow.js)
Users upload an image of a diseased plant leaf through the web interface.

The system classifies the disease on the frontend using TensorFlow.js, enabling real-time, offline-compatible prediction.

Reduces dependency on expert consultations and accelerates disease treatment.

📊 4. Interactive Dashboard
Visualizes weather trends, soil composition stats, and model predictions.

Real-time data fetching and charting using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts.

Personalized user experience with dynamic updates and intuitive layout.

👨‍🌾 5. User Authentication & Role Management
Secure login/signup system with JWT-based authentication.

Distinct roles for farmers, experts, and administrators.

Admin panel for managing models, datasets, and recommendations.

🧠 Machine Learning & AI
Model Training: Models are trained on labeled agricultural datasets (e.g., soil condition vs. crop yield, plant leaf images with disease labels).

Model Deployment: Deployed in-browser using TensorFlow.js for client-side execution, reducing latency and server load.

User-Trainable Option (Future Scope): Users may be allowed to upload custom datasets for continuous learning.

🚀 Future Enhancements:
Integration with IoT sensors for real-time soil data.

Support for regional languages for inclusivity.

Mobile app version using React Native.

Recommendation system for pesticides and crop rotation planning.

Chatbot assistant for live support.

📌 Impact:
AgroVision combines cutting-edge web technologies with real-world agricultural intelligence to serve as a smart companion for modern farmers. It not only reduces guesswork but also promotes informed decision-making, environmental sustainability, and enhanced productivity in the agricultural sector.
